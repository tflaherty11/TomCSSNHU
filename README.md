Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
- The goal of this project is to create an application that will help businesses track inventory and update stock items through a mobile application.
    - This is intended to help both entry level employees conduct stock audits and count items in their waehouse. The UI is simplistic and allows for any user to easily navigate to where they need to go.    
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
- My designs are user-oriented in the simplicity required to understand what the app is loking to do. The menu options are centralized and give users clear direction where they need to go in order to successfully update stock items.
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
- Online resources helped me with syntax and .xml tips, as this environment is very new to me. I reviewed ZyBooks to look at examples of code snippets that I could integrate into my project. I tried separating each function of the ap into a Database, Item and Main activity class.
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
- My code did not end up being functional, but my process was intermittenly testing code to see if anything worked. I also re-used code that I had from previous projects to update and change a value within a database. This may have been an issue but I could not find a solution to integrate all of these ideas.
Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
- My issue of finding proper .xml syntax was very challenging, but using the ZyBooks examples as base projects and then toying with these UI examples allowed me to understand the syntax required by each component.
In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
- My UI was the best part of this project, and I will continue to use this going forward inany future endeavor regarding Mobile Development.
